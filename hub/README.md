# hub

is the custom core of <b>"container-2-container-on-bare-metal router to control the verifiable sources of Data Inputs and Outputs</b>, acting as user's secure and private WiFi and IoT group-access from <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/home/" target="_blank">home</a> / <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/coloc/" target="_blank">coloc HOC</a> (Home Office Club) to enable the <b>Persona IoE</b> (Internet of Every Thing in one's OuterAgent / World / Cloud and InnerAgent / World / Cloud) to Free one from mundane works plus other services such as <b>private off-line backup of on-line data</b> after a specified time to save on-line storage cost of likely unused old data and/or already processed in LLM (Large Language Model), <b><a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/KpHealth/" target="_blank">emergency alert</a></b>, 100% privacy command centre, etc. It can be used as "home" and/or together with <b>coloc (CoLocation) / HOC (Home Office Clubs)</b> for possible off-line backup and/or used in Logistics Transportation or <b>tactical millitary operations</b>, etc. It enables faster integration and more holistic "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2023/09/awareness.html#Section_1" target="_blank">#Awareness, Dependent, #Prajna / Kiến Tánh, Duyên Khởi, Bát Nhã</a> from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVV09S5MDeQ" target="_blank">Democracy-Affirming Technologies</a> in the differences from <a href="https://estuary.dev/blog/debezium-alternatives/" target="_blank">Dembezium Perception and Reality</a>. 

The "hub" is "<b>tamper-proof software / hardware container with <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/db/" target="_blank">embedded db</a></b>" built from cloud-native standards of value-added services for "<b>Trusted Verifiable Data Inputs and Source of Outputs</b>, being (1) a home server and IoT hub of [ share-internet and wifi ] in (2) custom "<b>tamper-proof hardware</b>" for higher Trusted and Verifiable Data from [ <b>Machine &gt;&lt; Persona / AI Machine Learning &gt;&lt; Aesthetic Normative Intelligence</b> ] for data [ <b>Collection &gt;&lt; Insights  &gt;&lt; Action</b> ] in synchronization, backup and <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWrXsmMqFK8" target="_blank">Blockchain smart contracts of verifiable Supply-Chain Management directly from producers to consumers and/or wherever required such as Health Care or Legal Ssystems</a></b> of Trust Worthy relationships. It is an always-on tamper-proof (both hardware and software) <b>socket-server enabling at different security levels of your permitted communications and collaborations</b> with your online data in the distributed networks of <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/KpPlatform/" target="_blank">KpPlatform home on-line, off-line coloc HOC, and vault containers</a>. 

Via "hub" with the core of Rust code to CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) and UPI (Unified Payments Interface) including verifiable hardware/software sources and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZPPjAv12KU&t=914s" target="_blank">part of standard cloudevents for Serverless and Event-Driven Future</a> in standard <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/rust-wasm-and-edge-next-level-performance?edition=984203" target="_blank">WASM for edge computing</a>, easy and cost-effective upgrading processes from the <b>lowest security and privacy of VPN (Virtual Private Network) in both "home" and "travelling"</b> to the highest levels of security in both <b>the sources of information to secure tunnels in communications and collaborations</b>, there is a possibility to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0ztlIAYTCU" target="_blank">mathematically and privately model the nested and evolution of tetrahedrons "<b>IamX</b>" self</a> in the sharing where what happened in one will affect the whole - well-known in the butterfly effects applicable to "responsible" elites - and what movement in the whole will affect "<b>higher beings</b>" evolving in <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2023/09/a-light-out-of-darkness.html#Section_2.1" target="_blank">Fibonacci sequence toward a Golden Mean Ratio</a> of constitutional building blocks in the universe accessible at discovered <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2023/09/a-light-out-of-darkness.html#Section_2" target="_blank">Vertical Switches</a>.

It is the integration of <b>human radio technologies with discovered Consciousness technologies contributed by many dedicated explorers</b>. In this integration, the "<b>butterfly effects</b>" can be hard-wired from one's <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/KpPlatform/" target="_blank">protected ID of one-click ecommerce from KpPlatform</a> to directly communicate what most important to one with his/her connected <b><a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2023/09/list-of-figures-and-tables.html#Figure_11" target="_blank">circle and circles of inner circles in Inter-Realms Communications and Collaborations for one's Integrity</a></b>: three realms (human with lower and higher realms of your current quality) if available and verifiable in "<b>Proof of Stake</b>", three advanced centers (social, health, engineering), 5 closest personas of one's private subnet, one's "<b>Core / Alaya / Soul</b>" in one's Continuity of the consciousness.

The hub together with design from the scratch <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/rust-wasm-and-edge-next-level-performance" target="_blank">EDA (Event Driven Architecture) using [ Rust + WASM + EdgeComputing]</a> enable you <b>forming your own Inner circle</b> - where selected family members may or may not be parts - of what you consider most important for your presence and future of Not Only this life but few more steps ahead in your Continuity of the consciousness. It opens up a new Era of "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P76R8BQ4aL8" target="_blank">Inter-Realm Communications and Collaborations</a>" where the <b>outcomes of one's efforts can be continuous from this life to the next with one's Inner Circle</b>, including accumulated "<b><u>Value Transfer</u></b>" applicable to the Relevant Realm exactly as the exchange of one currency to another wherever one travel.
